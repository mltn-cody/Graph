The Plan for the controller(s).

The controller(s) are going to have endpoints that will be used by users to enter data. Eventually there will be 
a vetting process that will evaluate user submissions. But the minimum requirement is to have a word with origin 
and definition. 

Princeton has a project called as word net graph but it is isolated, and not easily updated. There is also no
business attached to it, useless. The role of the business man is to find uses for technology, the role of
the engineer is to find uses / application for theory. I'm an engineer and a wannabe businessman / entrepreneur
( questionable ) you've an idea and a technology and a path toward execution of that idea. 

See it through.
