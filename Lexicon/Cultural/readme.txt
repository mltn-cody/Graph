Cultural.
The concepts expressed by a language are determined by the environment, activities,
and culture of the people who speak the language. Since French,
Chinese, and Indian cuisines are based on very different ingredients,
methods of preparation, and cooking utensils, the people who cook and eat each kind of food use words
for it that have no counterparts in the other cultures. The specialized concepts, however,
can be transferred with the culture whenever a cook opens a new restaurant in a foreign land.
Cultural and conceptual shifts occur across time as well as space. A book on science or business,
for example, is easier to translate from modern English to modern Japanese than from modern English
to the language of Shakespeare.
