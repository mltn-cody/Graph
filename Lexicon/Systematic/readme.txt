Systematic. 

The grammar of a language determines how the conceptual structures are linearized as strings of words in a sentence. 
English and Chinese, for example, put the subject first, the verb in the middle, and the object at the end for an
SVO word order.

Irish and Biblical Hebrew are VSO languages that put the verb first.  Latin and Japanese are SOV languages that
put the verb at the end.The grammar also determines how the units of meaning, called morphemes, are combined 
to form words.

Chinese is an extreme example of an analytic language in which almost all the morphemes can be used as
stand-alone words. German is an agglutinative language, which forms compound words like 
Lebensversicherungsgesellschaftsangestellter (life insurance company employee). 
Old English was an agglutinative language like German, but as it evolved into modern English,
it became almost as analytic as Chinese.
